# Project Ideas

* Password Cracker
	* Maybe use dictionaries of passwords (or password hashes) and try to guess a user's password based on an encrypted hash submitted from the program user
	* Make it cool and stuff
* Blockchain
	* How does a cryptocurrency work?
	* Simulate a cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) by using Blockchain ideology
	* Make secure transactions between multiple users
	* Every user in the system has a copy of the ledger of *all transactions*
* Club Website
	* Host projects from different teams all in one place
	* People viewing the site can download source code of projects and check them out on Github
	* People can comment on projects -- do they need to be logged in..?
	* Is styled nicely and looks very cool
	* Club members can submit their projects to the website
	* Any user can post a project idea for someone else to make
	* Projects like Blockchain can be integrated into the site; the site hosts the cryptocurrency, and it can be used as a reward for other users of the site
	* (Also has to be very cool)
